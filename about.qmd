## Bruin Sports Analytics

Cleaned and analyzed various NBA datasets to determine if there is a correlation between draft ranking and player performance using Google Sheets, Tableau, and R to display results. Summarized, simplified, and explained results in a [published article](https://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/post/nba-draft-analysis).

## Math 42

Worked with a team to examine the methodology and results of using logistic and LASSO regression to predict wildfire occurrences and burned areas based on various relevant variables. Cleaned a dataset of 517 wildfires, coded and applied regression models, tested and trained the dataset, and analyzed the predictive models. Summarized and graphed results and noted improvements that could be made.
